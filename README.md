# Pokedex Webpage

## Overview
This website was created as a practice project for using the Caching API with a rest API [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)
## Features
- The website will fetch data from the REST API and represent it as a pokedex using html tables
- The api calls are cached using [Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache), this way we don't need to call the api since data is already stored on the local server, saving us API calls and faster responses
## Running the project
- You only need the files in the src folder and also the index.html on the root directory to run your website based on what you've seen in my github page :)
